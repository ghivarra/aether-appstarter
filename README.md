# Aether Appstarter
The starter project for Aether PHP Framework

# Aether
My own private PHP Framework. Heavily-inspired by CodeIgniter. 

## Reason
Yet another PHP Frameworks, I know, but I kinda take what I like from CodeIgniter and Laravel as CodeIgniter is small-print but the core system is too complicated even though it is quite easy too use and Laravel is too bloated but developer-friendly.

- I love CodeIgniter, but its complicated core system got me a headache just to fork + improve it.
- I kinda like Laravel, but too bloated for me and the overheads is nasty. Good for low to medium project but I always throw laravel out of the window if I have to create huge user project with limited server budget.
